# Image-> image loader, blur, radius,color,

# Text -> blur,image loader, height, weight,

# View -> Height , weight, alignItems: 'flex-end' (right left) | justifyContent: 'flex-end'(up and down)

        justifyContent  and alignItem control the child but if you want that child can control itself then we use align-self property,
        opacity: 0.2, (color fade)

        Flex:-  if you make the view relative then you can use property like bottom: 0, left,right,topbl
